With simple words, yesterday (Sunday, June 02 2013) I had some kind of Satori
 with the results following. I came to conclusion and explained myself that
 really life is nothing but a pattern in the dust and I felt joyously suicidal 
 like a robot that "figured it all out" and entered into "successful 
 completion" state. 
 
The following folder describes powerful emotions of ideas comming to fruition,
 things that are actually useful for a better experience of this otherwise
 dreadful scenario called life.
 
Just stroll around and imagine what a day that was! Enjoy!

"Right on, brother!"
